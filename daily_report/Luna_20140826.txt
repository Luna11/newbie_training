In the morning, I flash factory image to TC70-GA unit. Originally I though
it is a very simple thing even don't need to do it. But in the process,
I encountered two problems. One is fastboot locked and need to unlock it before
flash image. For this project, the unlock command is "fastboot oem unlock moto_pollux".
The other is permission denied during flash the image. I had no idea about it 
for I have change root authority when flash the image. Then in the colleague's
suggestion, I find there's "./" path before the flash command in the flash.sh file.
But I have set the path in the environment. This is the reason why it showed
permission denied and it is ok after removing the "./"

In the afternoon, I finished the insert sort function of the weekly programming ex04.
It is a original version and I will improve it later to compare the amount of
time spent.
