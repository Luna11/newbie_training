Today my main task is to finish the link exercise. I added the insert and
delete function in the program.

My insert/delete function is to insert/delete a node at a special location
in the link.
I used a loop to search this special location. There are three result. 
1. If the location is in the range of the link, the function is ok. 
2. But if the location is over the range one or two number, the function is failed. 
3. If the location is over the range more than two numbers, the function is ok.

So, I think it is the border issue. But I haven't solved this issue till now.
My mind is stop running now. I have to try it tomorrow.
