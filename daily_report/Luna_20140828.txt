Yesterday I finished the weekly programming ex04 sort function with different
methods. The amount of time cost with different method are abviously not the
same.
Then I tried the special number such as ascending ordered numbers and equal numbers 
with one sort method. The time always cost 0 no matter how large amounts of data.

Today my main task is to study the gpio. I knew the method of control it with
register, but I don't know how to control it in a kernel. It seems a large task 
and need to read the circuit diagram to determine which IO to control and how to. In a word, I am very dizzy now.
