Today, I finally finished the linux ex06 - the time and delay. Before my doubt
is where to set the delay. So I stayed the beginning and don't know what to do.
Yestoday, I though I must do something. So I referred book finished a timer.
After finishing it, I suddenly understand I can set delay wherever I want to.

Then I set a delay in the open function of a character driver. I can see the
delay result by a user test file. But I met a problem. Now I will introduce 
my user test file first before decripting the problem.

The user test file as follows:
    printf("now, let's open the device miscdev, starting......\n");
	int fd = open("/dev/miscdev", O_RDWR);
	... ...
	printf("device miscdev opened\n");

The idea result is that putout "now, let's open the device miscdev, starting......"
and delay a moment, then putout "device miscdev opened". For I set the delay
function in the open function of the miscdev.

But the true result is: delay a moment first, then putout "now, let's open 
the device miscdev, starting ......" and "device miscdev opened". Of course,
the rate of this problem is not 100%, and sometimes the result can meet my idea.

I really don't understand.
