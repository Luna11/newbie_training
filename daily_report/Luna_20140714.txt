Today I finished the allocation of the device number and node making.
I used two ways to allocate the device number, which are manual and automatic.
Then check it from /proc/devices.

During the initialization of the cdev,I met two errors and had been resolved. 
In addition, the file_operations structure are still not clear.
The assignment are globalmem_llseek/globalmem\_read..., and I am not clear why 
these are function name. After the assignment statement,  
it is a comma instead of a semicolon in this structure, this problem is not clear also.
