I read the content of ioctl() function almost the whole day and 
have a little know about it. But still have some confusing.

The command number generate is a bit of bother. There are 4 micros 
to generate cmd number. The example use same micros command with 
different sequential numbesr. And this confused me.

For now, maybe I should spend more time to study the ioctl() function.
