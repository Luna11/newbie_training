Today I try to solve the problem that filezilla can't save the password. This problem 
cause me input passwork every time I login the ftp. I really can't stand it.
I spent some time to solve it and the result is ok. But the funny thing is I
don't know why and how.

The other task is analyze the issue that happened on THD OOB. The issue is that
it will show ThreatDetectionService stopped when boot machine and it will not
recovery after reboot. In the normal logcat, we can find ThreatDetectionService
is detecting the root authority. If login with root, this service will warning 
or do other action to protect user's next actions. 

Now the problem we met is ThreatDetectionService stopped which also cause user
can't do any action after boot to os. Why is it stopped?? Which program control it?? 
No solution......
