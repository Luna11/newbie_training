Today I read the concurrency and race conditions. I think the code is easy,
for it is only down() and up() releated function. The difficulty is which 
data we should protect. And should pay attention up the semaphore in time.

So in the afternoon, I review the ex02 char driver again. And I find some
content are clear but some are still not clear. I plan to try the ex02 again
referencing the scull's memory usage.
