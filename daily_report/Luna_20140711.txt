Another weekend is coming, time flies really fast. 
This weekï¼ŒI only finished a simplyest module insmod and rmmod. 
I feel the speed of progress is slow and this happened not only 
code writing but also reading. 
I think the reason is I am not familiar with the content.

So far, I just finished the node create of char driver content. 
And later I will try to finish the code of this part. 
I feel char driver content is so large and I plan to divide it 
to several parts then finish them one by one.

The first one is to make node. I will try to finish it this weekend. 
If it is pass, then cut in file operations.

Today I was reading books mainly, and no specific problem. 
The general feeling is too slow, this part is not well understood.
