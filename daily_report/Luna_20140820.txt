Now it is 3:00pm, I still tried to load the character driver which I wrote
before to the kernel. But it is failed. And I have no idea about it.

Although the result is failed, I have known the basic process of loading
a program to the kernel. The process probably includes three steps.

1. Make a folder under the /kernel/drivers director. Put your .c(here it is
test.c) and .h files under the new folder. And you must make two files 
"Makefile" and "Kconfig" under this folder. The Makefile includes 
"obj-$(CONFIG_TEST) += test.o". Here the result of $(CONFIG_TEST) is y, n or m. 
The Kconfig file use key word "config" to define an new configure option.
This new configure option can be found in the menuconfig. And the setting
in the menuconfig function as the result of $(CONFIG_TEST) y, n or m.
This is the step one - finished the layer of test driver itself. But the Makefile
and Kconfig both are recursived. So we must change the upper files.

2. Change the Makefile and Kconfig files in the upper layer(here it is drivers). 
In the Makefile, add "obj-$(CONFIG_TEST) +=test/". And in the Kconfig,
add "source "drivers/test/Kconfig" ".

3. make menuconfig to set the configure option, then make to compile.

After this two days' learning, I known the Makefile is rule of compile and
whether to compile is defined by configuration.
