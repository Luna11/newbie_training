This morning, I run the char device driver which is finished several days ago.
It seems that the read function is not ready. The compiling is ok, but can't 
cat anything after echo messages. I have not solved this problem. 
And this driver has another issue, that is the system will show pipe broken
after rmmod this drver module. The same result, I can't solve it.

Then in the afternoon, I turned to do the third excesize misc char driver.
Spending about 4 hours, I finished it and it run no problem.

Of course, there are some issues when compiling. But there's no much 
difficulties except one. That is caused by the missing property "const" 
when declarating the second argument in the write function.

In this misc driver, I test the read and write function with echo and cat
commands. Both are ok. 

But I have to spend some time to solve the ex02 char driver problem.
