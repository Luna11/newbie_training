I have finished the ioctl() function and user test application at last!
Feels so good.

I writed a .h file for the cmd argument. So it can be included in the driver
program and user test application. Now, the .h file is not perfect and I will
improve it later.

There's a problem when writing the .h file. The magic number is difficult 
to determined, for I can't find the file "ioctl-number.txt" to check 
which number is used.
