Today I mainly loaded the char driver which wrote several days ago to the 
andriod kernel. I refered to a webpage to do it. During the progress, there
are many problems although it includes only about 8 steps.

The first problem: make menuconfig command failed, and not show the selection
page. The solution is install build-essential and libncurses5-dev.

The second problem: It always show some .h files not exist when run make under
kernel director. The solution is run "make bootimage" under andriod director.

Now the third problem is coming, the compile result is failed. I have no energy
to solve it today. It is tomorrow's task.
