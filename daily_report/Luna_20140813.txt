This morning, I read the time, delays and deferred work releated content.
I am confused, don't know what to do. And I am stressed, so I had to study
it again later.

In the afternoon, I turn to weekly programming exercise. In this filed, I
just finished two exercises. I try to finish the third ex this week. This
afternoon, I finish the link create function and output function. Follow
this speed of progress, I think I could finish it this week.

In the create function, I used a char which is got through scanf() function
to control the input frequency. But it is not right, so adopt colleague's
advise to use string instead of single char. My code run successfully after
this improvement.
