Today my main task is to finish the basic frame of the char device driver. 
This is my goal which is setted by myself. And I have finished it.
Also, this task had been finished before system was broken and 
today I done it again to review it.

Till now, my chardrv.c includes the basic char device driver 
but without file operation functions. And these are next tasks which  
I plan to finish them within two days. 

This time I will push it to github even it is not a completed file, 
in order to prevent losing it.
