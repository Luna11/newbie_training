I read the content of character device driver in the morning, 
and the next work is the file operation function writting.
In the afternoon, I finished the sorting ex01 which done yesterday 
with out bitmap. But the basic idea is same.
Space complexity estimation will increase a lot when not using bit, 
and in my opinion, larger space will cause larger time spending 
base on other conditions maintained.
It need to be calculated specifically how much it is.
Of course, time and space complexity are difficult, and need take more time to study.
