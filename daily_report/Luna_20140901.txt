Today my main task is read the touch FW update related code which is modified 
by Guangwei.
There are two main changes in the code. One is change the current to 2ma from
8ma via modifing the .drv of struct gpiomux_setting gsbi3_active_cfg. The other
change is adding attribute in sysfs and echo 0 to disable irq before the FW update.

Then I study the interface function DEVICE_ATTR of sysfs. The prototype is
#define DEVICE_ATTR(_name, _mode, _show, _store) struct device_attribute dev_attr_##_name=__ATTR(_name, _mode, _show, _store)
_show means read function, and _store is write function.
This macro included in the <linux/device.h>.

The step of interface creatation as below:
1. static DEVICE_ATTR(irq_enable, S_IWUGO, NULL, mxt_irq_enable_store);
2. static struct attribute *mxt_attrs[] = { &dev_attr_irq_enable.attr, NULL};
In theory, we can add any device interface as long as we need in these two point.
3. package it: static struct attribute_group mxt_attr_group = { .attrs = mxt_attrs, };
4. sysfs_create_group(&client->dev.kobj, &mxt_attr_group);
Now the interface creatation is completed.

This content is I find in the web and I refered it to read the modified code. 
The next task is create a interface by myself.
