I am a little depressed these days for the problem of Ubuntu. 
Today, the Ubuntu is ready to use finally. But there is still 
other problem of build image which is not solved. And I will 
try to run it again tonight.

Today I take the time to write a program to generate random numbers,
and push it on the GitHub. In this program, I invoked the lib function
fprintf() which I do not want to use originally.

I can only choose this fprintf() function for others can't run 
successfully. And I will try again with other functions later.

Next, I must pay attention to char device driver and finish it as soon as possible.
