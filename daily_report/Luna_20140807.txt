This morning, I returned to the linux ex02 to solve the problem - can't 
write/read. I don't know where is the problem. Compiling is ok. And there's
no any error showed when echo and cat. Also there's no any message showed 
in the terminal. I even don't know which function has problem, the read or 
the write. I spent about 2 hours trying to solve the problem, but the result
is depressed.

In the afternoon, I had to seek help from colleagues. And this problem cost
him more time. At the end, he find one pointer points to error position, 
which lead to writing character string to inappropriate user space address.
The same time, this issue lead to the kernel crash when remove this module.

A careless action costs me so much time to find out it~~~~
