Today, I read the misc char driver contents but not done it. Via reading I 
know that Misc drivers share some common characteristics and kernel abstract
these commonalities into an API and this simplifies the initialized way 
of misc drivers.

So the initialized way is very simply. But this misc driver just has major
number 10 and this lead to it can't driver multiple devices.

This afternoon I read the ioctl() function, but I am mishmash. Depressed~~
