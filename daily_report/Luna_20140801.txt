Today, I mainly run the random data generation programs and compared the 
differences, especially the running time.

When I tried to generate 90,000 random numbers between 1 to 100000, it cost 
about 27s with traversing method but only about 0.2s with bit map method.

When the number of random data generation reach to 900,000, the traversing 
method will cost about 46mins but bit map only cost about 2.3s. The difference
is suprising!

Then I changed the number of random data to 9000,000. The bit map method
cost about 27s. And the travesing method show "core dumped" error. I think
it is because the array int a[9000000] need too large memory. Of couse, 
this is just my idea and not be confirmed.
