Today I finish the insertion and removement of the most simple module "Hello world". I am so happy.
I used Makefile to compile the .c file today and it is successful. But it doesn't mean I have known Makefile. I just used it by modifying the example.
To understand it, need further study.
Today there are two questions which have not be solved. 
The first, messages will not show in the terminal display after insmod, and only be displayed by command "cat /var/log/messages". Secondly, messages will not show out after setting log level as <1> KERN_ALERT when using printk command, but it will show after delete the setting "KERN_ALERT".
Isn't it level <4> after delete the setting "KERN_ALERT"?? Looking for answers......
