Today, I mainly exercise the first weekly programming ex01, 
which is about the sort and suggested to use bitmap.
I wrote a source file, but no output. 
Estimation I used the fscanf function. 
In the help of colleagues, using fread to achieve the sort function. 
However, I'm still a little confused, but it is late and 
I plan it as tomrrow's task.
