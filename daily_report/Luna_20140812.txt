Today I finished the linux ex05 code of concurrency and race condition. But
I have not completed how to test this function.

In this function, I met a problem that is kernel will crashed when inserting
this module. Then I find it will be ok when put the sema_init() function after
the kmalloc function. Thinking for a long time, I still can't find out the 
reason. Then I had to turn to ask colleague. After colleague's explanation,
I immediately understand. The first argument of sema_init() is a address, 
and it is included in a struct, so the address is not certain if it is used
before kmalloc memory to the struct. In this condition, it can lead to unknown
risk such as kernel crashed.

This afternoon, we learn the vim usage. It is so powerful and functional. I
should spend more time to study it.
