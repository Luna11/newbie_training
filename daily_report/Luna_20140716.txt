Tell the truth, I am a little off-kilter this afternoon. 
So I will go off work early.
In the morning I completed the sorting program. 
Bit operation is not good and need more learning to strengthen it.
In the afternoon, I force yourself to read part of the contents of the character device driver 
and had a preliminary understanding to the general framework.
I will know the details during programming process.
