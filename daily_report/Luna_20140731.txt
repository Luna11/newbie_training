I tryied to build Futon kk image again yesterday night, and the same result
is ubuntu show "pipe broken". 

It is because I installed "libgl1-mesa-dri:i386". The system will remove 
ubuntu-desktop during installing this package, and this is the reason why
can't enter xwindow after reboot.

I install ubuntu again this morning without "libgl1-mesa-dri:i386",  
and build the image.
Now it seems ok. Later I will flash it to unit to check whether
it is really ok.

This afternoon, I finished the generation of random data with traversing method.
It cost more time when deal with the first number a[0]. I can't deal with it
with the same rule with other numbers and finally I had to handle it especially.
