Today I mainly finished the TC70 release image. Before, the compile is always fail. 
This morning we totally found the reason that is we did not put the license in the image.
Then I build a new image referring the SOP.

In the afternoon, I mainly check the logcat file to search the reason for THD OOB issue - ThreatDetectionService stop run. I find there's no below 3 lines in the NG log.
1. I/ThreatDetectionService( 1052): {"MaxPasswordLimit":{"enable":"false"}}
2. I/ThreatDetectionService( 1052): threat_json_string : {"MaxPasswordLimit":{"enable":"false"}}
3. I/ThreatDetectionService( 1052): FILE PATH : /data/data/com.motorolasolutions.emdk.threatdetectionservice/files/MaxPasswordLimit
But I don't know whether it is useful for solving the problem.
