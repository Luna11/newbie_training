Today I finished the char driver preliminarily but don't know how to test
whether it is ok.

And the ioctl() function is not clear for me. I don't know the parameter cmd
include which numbers and the corresponding functions.

But I think I must go forword and look for the answers later. It seems that
I can't easily find the answers now and must go ahead to read more contents.
Maybe I could find the answers tomorrow, maybe it will need more time, but I
plan to finish it this week.

In addition, I have not built the image since some sources are not installed 
in my OS. It is a troublesome thing too.
